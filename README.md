# Paste Repeater

## About
  This package will let you paste your system's clipboard into a file multiple times. So instead of hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> two dozen times, you can use this package to paste your clipboard as many times as you'd like in a single command.

## Usage
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>v</kbd>

-- or --

Tools -> Command Palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and type `repeater`.  

## What Happens
The Atom Command Palette input panel will ask you how many times you'd like to paste your clipboard into the editor. Your system's clipboard will be pasted into the editor at the cursor's current location the number of times you request.
